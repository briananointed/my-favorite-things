      <h4>&nbsp;You are probably thinking this blog was made by a lady.<br/>You are wrong!
          The world has tricked you into thinking pink is for ladies</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken<br/><img src="images/chicken.jpg" alt="chicken"></li>

        <li>Rabbits</li>
          <img src="images/rabbit.jpg" alt="rabbit">
        <li>Cats</li>
          <img src="images/cat.jpg" alt="cat">
        <li>Chicks</li>
          <img src="images/chick.jpg" alt="chick">
      </ul>
      <p>Its such a breathtaking experience for me.If you have watched
         chicken then you know most times they shy off from sight when
         you stare at them. They just don't want it to be worth your
         while.Now the chicks are the hillarious ones. They do all manner
         of stuff to get your attention so that you come and feed them.
         They can cry all night just for you to come
      </p>
      <h4>There is one special creature I'd like to separately handle</h4>
      <em>and many more will come but lemme start with this</em>
      <ol>
        <li>CATS!!</li>
          <img src="images/cat2.jpg" alt="cat passport">
      </ol>
      <p>So these beings like attacking almost everything they find.Statistics
        show that about one-third of a cat's day is spent killing, or at least
        attempting to kill small creatures. Answers every question right? Ik :)
        I just like how these soft animals want to be pampered like ladies.</p>
