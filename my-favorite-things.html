      <p>Its such a breathtaking experience for me.If you have watched
         chicken then you know most times they shy off from sight when
         you stare at them. They just don't want it to be worth your
         while.Now the chicks are the hillarious ones. They do all manner
         of stuff to get your attention so that you come and feed them.
         They can cry all night just for you to come
